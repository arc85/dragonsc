Description: This package uses a deterministic algorithm inspired by "Deterministic 	Annealing for Clustering, Compression, Classification, Regression and Related 	Optimization Problems" in Proceedings of the IEEE, November 1998 by Kenneth 	Rose. It uses PCA components from single-cell expression and "temperatures" 	inspired by the physical process of annealing. This leads to a deterministic 	solution that avoids local minima common to cluster algorithms.
